## Folders

### Media assets and files

Hugo optmizes all assets that are used, and will create a [webp file](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) from the .jpg or .png images.  "WebP is a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. Using WebP, webmasters and web developers can create smaller, richer images that make the web faster." The creation of the `.webp` files is automatic and remains behind the scenes: any `.jpg` or `.png` file that is used from the `assets/media/` folder and its subfolders will be automatically converted to `.webp`.

- `/assets/media/img/`: contains subfolders with png or jpg images. For example, all images that were used in blog posts in the year 2022 (so far) can be found in `/assets/media/img/blogposts_2022/`. The screenshots or cover images of reports created with the Digital Music Observatory are in `assets/media/img/reports/`

- `assets/media/img/logos/` contain logos.  Please do not use bigger than about 2000x2000 pixel versions.  When needed, a copy of the logo can be saved as `avatar.png` or `avatar.jpg` [see text files above].

- `/assets/media/albums/` contain image albums that should be viewed together in as an image gallery.

- `/assets/documents/` can be used to upload downloadable articles, PDF files, or anything that is not an image.
