Listen Local Judaica is an experimental data service that helps connect the music heritage and new, vibrant music scene of the Jewish diaspora worldwide, interconnecting it with libraries, music libraries, heritage organizations, global music encyclopedias, and at the same time, find audiences for them.  The Listen Local Judaica datasets are offered in various serialization formats via JudaicaLink that comply with the RDF standard. The sole aim of the following tables in their minimal forms is to provide a technical handshake with JudaicaLink and eventually Europeana. Once the technical standards and curatorial policy standards are met, we will provide further music with more persons and genres included.
