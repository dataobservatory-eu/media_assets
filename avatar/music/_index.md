The [Digital Music Observatory](project/music-observatory/)  is a fully automated, open source, open data observatory that links public datasets in order to provide a comprehensive view of the European music industry. The DMO produces key business and policy indicators that enable the growth of music business strategies and national music policies in a way that works both for music lover audiences and the creative enterprises of the sector, and contributes to a more competitive, fair and sustainable European music ecosystem.

Our data pillars are following the structure laid out in the [Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory](post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/): [Music Economy](/pillars/music-and-society/); [Diversity & Circulation](/pillars/diversity-circulatoin/); [Music & Society](/pillars/music-and-society/) and [Innovation - innovative data applications](/#usecases)

Our Product/Market Fit was validated in the world's 2nd ranked university-backed incubator program, the [Yes!Delft AI Validation Lab](post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/). We are currently developing this project with the help of the [JUMP European Music Market Accelerator](https://www.jumpmusic.eu/fellow2021/automated-music-observatory/) program.

Music is one of the most data-driven service industries where the majority of sales are already made by AI-driven autonomous systems.  The DMO is a fully-functional service that can function as a testing ground of the `European Data Strategy`, showcasing the ways in which the music industry is affected by the problems that the `Digital Services Act` and the `Trustworthy AI` initiatives attempt to regulate. If these policies will work for the European microenterprise-dominated, complex and fragile European music ecosystem, then they are likely to make Europe fit for the digital age.
