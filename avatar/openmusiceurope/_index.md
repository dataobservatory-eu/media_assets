The [OpenMuse](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/project/openmuse/) project brings together music industry stakeholders and researchers from 12 European countries. Our partners represent the diversity of the industry, as well as the shared need to find financially, socially, and environmentally sustainable policy and business models in multiple, sometimes-fragmented streams (e.g., live music, composers/publishers, and recordings with producers and performers).

Our data pillars are following the structure laid out in the [Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory](music.dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/): [Music Economy](music.dataobservatory.eu/pillars/music-and-society/); [Diversity & Circulation](music.dataobservatory.eu/pillars/diversity-circulatoin/); [Music & Society](music.dataobservatory.eu/pillars/music-and-society/) and [Innovation - innovative data applications](music.dataobservatory.eu/#usecases)
